        <h1>Best Movies Of All Time According To Emmanuel</h1>
        <h2>My Best Three(3)</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>1. VINLAND SAGA</h3>
        
        <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/in/tv-show/vinland-saga"> <img src="../assets/images/Vinland_Saga_volume_01_cover.jpg" alt="picture of Vinland saga" height="200" width="350" /></a>
        <p>A well developed story that drops all pretenses of a typical anime
            and goes out of its way to build realistic and understandable 
            characters that fit perfectly in the time period that they exist in.</p>

        <h3>2. AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER (2022)</h3>
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1630029/"><img src="../assets/images/AVATAR WAY OF WATER.jpg" alt="picture of Avatar" height="200" width="350"></a>
        
        
        <p>Critics Consensus: Narratively, it might be fairly standard stuff -- but visually speaking, Avatar: 
            The Way of Water is a stunningly immersive experience.</p>

        <h3>3. JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 (2023)</h3>
        <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/ph/movie/john-wick-chapter-4"> <img src="../assets/images/John-Wick_Chapter-4.jpg" alt="John Wick" height="200" width="350" /></a>
       
        <p>John Wick: Chapter 4 piles on more of everything -- and suggests that when it comes to a well-dressed
            Keanu Reeves dispatching his enemies in lethally balletic style, there can never be too much</p>
